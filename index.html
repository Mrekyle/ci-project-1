                First class Pass driving school was founded back in 2021. We have since become one of the 
                most recognisable and well known schools in the Colchester area. We now offer lessons all around
                the Colchester, Ipswich, Braintree and Clacton area. Our team of dedicated instructors are able to 
                teach either Manual or Automatic.

                We are also able to help you with your theory test with access to Theory Test Pro, to assist in 
                booking your theory and your practical tests when you are ready.

                I was recommended to go with <strong>Rick</strong> by a friend who said he was a brilliant driving instructor –
                and I couldn’t agree more! Right from my first lesson, he was very calm (which was always very 
                reassuring). He was especially helpful when it came to making sure I was comfortable while still
                making sure I was making good progress! With <strong>Rick's</strong> help, I passed first time and couldn’t be happier! 
                If anybody is considering learning to drive, then I would highly recommend <strong>Rick!</strong> Thank you again!

                I recently passed my practical driving test thanks to Philip at First Class Pass! I definitely recommend Philip
                 and First Class Pass, as I received a professional but personal service and even though my driving was interrupted 
                 by going to university and lockdowns, driving lessons were always a relaxed and stress-free environment 
                 to learn. <strong>Phillip</strong> was always patient and made me feel comfortable driving. 100% recommend!

                I am so happy with First Class Pass. <strong>Mandy</strong> my instructor was amazing. I cannot be happier, she communicated with me amazingly. 
                Was very calm, patient and understanding with me through out all my lesson. Wouldn’t have been able to pass first 
                time without her! 10/10 would recommend

                I would highly recommend <strong>Keiran</strong> and First Class Pass driving school for anyone looking to learn! <strong>Keiran</strong> always made lessons 
                enjoyable and helped me conquer my nerves, making me feel confident on the road. Couldn’t be happier with my first time pass 
                today with only 3 driving faults!
