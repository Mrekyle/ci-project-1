        <!-- What we offer card sections - About the lessons -->

        <div class="offer-card">
            <h4>Weekly</h4>
            <p>We reccomend having a driving lesson at least once a week. Ideally with a 2 hour lesson.
                This will ensure that you are soaking up as much as possible and become as comfortable 
                as you can before your test.
            </p>
            <p>Towards the end of your lessons, your instructor will perform a mock test with you. This is to
                give you an idea of what to expect on the day and to see if you are ready to pass 1st time.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="offer-card">
            <h4>Intensive Lessons</h4>
            <p>With our intensive lessons, depending on the hours booked will define how quick the lessons
                 are undertaken (Monday to Friday). During this style of lesson we reccomend to drive atleat 2 hours a day but 
                 no longer than 5. This is to ensure you get what you need to pass the test.
